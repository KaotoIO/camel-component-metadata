    description: |-
      The Google Sheets component provides access to Google Sheets via the Google Sheets Web APIs.

      Google Sheets uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authenticating a Google account and authorizing access to user data. Before you can use this component, you will need to create an account and generate OAuth credentials. Credentials comprise of a clientId, clientSecret, and a refreshToken. A handy resource for generating a long-lived refreshToken is the OAuth playground.

      In the case of a service account, credentials comprise of a JSON-file (keyResource). You can also use delegation domain-wide authority (delegate) and one, several, or all possible Sheets API Auth Scopes (scopes).

      bridgeErrorHandler:
        title: Bridge Error Handler
        description: Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.

      lazyStartProducer:
        title: Lazy Start Producer
        description: Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camelâ€™s routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing.
